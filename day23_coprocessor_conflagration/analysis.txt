Taken at face value, the assembly program
runs the following procedure:

a = 1
b = 67
c = b

if a != 0: 
    goto: label_1  # this is a switch for part1/part2

goto: label_2 # we never exec this in part 2

label_1:
    
    # set up b and c to their initial values (67*100+100000 and 67*100+100000+17000 respectively)
    # notice that b and c differ by 17000
    
    b = b * 100
    b = b + 100000
    c = b
    c = c + 17000
    
    # code up to here is never repeated
    
    label_2: # will end up being a while loop that goes until b <= c with increment of 17
        f = 1 # loop init
        d = 2 # loop init
        
        label_5: # will end up being nested loop going from 2 up to b (loop for e)
            e = 2 # loop init
            
            label_4: # loop start for 2 up to b (loop for d)
                g = d        
                g = g * e
                g = g-b     # these 3 lines do: g = d*e - b
                
                if g != 0: # basically if d*e != b,
                    goto: label_3  # this skips f = 0
                
                f = 0
                       # from label_4 to label_3, basically we have:
                       # if d*e == b:
                       #     f = 0

                    if g != 0: # check if e reached b (e-b != 0)
                        goto: label_4 # if not, start loop again at label_4
                    
                    d = d + 1 # increment d
                    g = d
                    g = g - b

                    # we're outside the two nested loops for e and d
                    
                    
                    # check if f has been set to 0. This happens wayyy up between label_4 and label_3 if the check e*d == b is satisfied.
                    if f != 0:
                        goto: label_6 # if f==0, skip h = h + 1
                    
                    h = h + 1 # increment h
                    
                    label_6:
